# Environment

All the packages and their versions are included in the **requirements.txt** file. The recommended way to run this code is to use a **virtual environment**. After activating the virtual environment and installing all the dependencies, there are two variables that need to be taken into account when running the code (variables inside the main.py file):
- *INPUT_DIR*: where the images will be read from
- *OUTPUT_DIR*: where the results will be stored

To actually run the code, the *main.py* file needs to be executed with the command *python main.py*.
